Her interests lie in science communication and analyzing/interpreting data for stories to make positive change. Her undergraduate project studied the origination of floc events (loose fine bacterial particles erupting like "snow") in harsh deep-sea volcanic environments that she had the wonderful blessing to witness on the Visions '18 expedition to Axial Seamount, Pacific Ocean. She also enjoyed being a peer mentor and lab TA for students in introduction Geology/Env Sci classes to spark interest in students to learn about our planet in order to love and preserve it. After graduation, she works as a digital marketing specialist with hopes to use her skills to continue her mission to spark knowledge about the Earth for its preservation on a larger public scale. She also enjoys spending quality time with her family, swimming, hiking and exploring new places.</p>
